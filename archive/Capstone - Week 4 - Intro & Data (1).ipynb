    "Often called, the city 'that never sleeps' New York City is a city known around the world for food, fashion, and culture. Manhattan, a borough, is known as one of the most expensive real estate areas in the world based and an epicenter for tourists and residents alike. For a city that never sleeps, there must be major opportunities to start a 24/7 coffee shop within Manhattan.
